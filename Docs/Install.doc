@section setup_git_sect Setup Git With GitHub

If this is your first time to use Git or GitHub, follow these steps.

   -# Install Git version 1.6.5.1<BR>
      http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tickzoom/TickZoomPublic/Git-1.6.5.1-preview20091022.exe <BR>

   http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tickzoom/TickZoomPublic/TortoiseGit-1.2.1.0-32bit.msi

You have completed setup and install of Git with GitHub. Now proceed with setup of TickZooom.

@section setup_clone_sect Setup Your Clone of the Source for TickZoom

   -# Select a folder in Windows Explorer where you want to keep your TickZoomPublic source project.
   -# Right-click on that folder in Windows Explorer and select "Git Clone..." to open the clone window.
      TortoiseGit added the "Git Clone..." menu item when you installed it.
   -# Paste the following into the URL field:
      @verbatim git://github.com/tickzoom/TickZoomPublic.git @endverbatim
      Accept the other defaults and click okay.
   -# You will see the progress as it creates the TickZoomPublic folder. That takes about 30 to 60 seconds.

@section setup_run_sect Setup To Write Your Own Strategies

   -# You need an IDE if you don’t have one. Either SharpDevelop or Visual Studio will work. You can find installation tips for those further below, after this section.
   -# Once you complete installation of SharpDevelop or Visual Studio, then you can navigate to the TickZoomPublic folder in Windows Explorer, then find the Platform\\TickZoom.sln file and open it in either SharpDevelop or Visual Studio.
   -# Right click on the GUI project and select "Set as StartUp Project" in SharpDevelop or similar in Visual Studio.
   -# Run the application using the big green arrow at the stop of SharpDevelop or similar in Visual Studio.
   -# TickZoom will select your disk drive with the largest amount of free space and create the folder called TickZoom at the root of that drive.
   -# If you already have a TickZoom folder at the root of any of a disk drive, then TickZoom will "self configure" by locating and attaching to that one.
   -# Next download the Sample data and extract it into your TickZoom folder. If you don’t know where it is, you can find it at the top of your disk drive with the largest amount of free space. For example:
      C:\\TickZoom or E:\\TickZoom<BR>

@section sharpd_setup Setup SharpDevelop for TickZoom

   -# Install SharpDevelop 3.1<BR>
      http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tickzoom/TickZoomPublic/SharpDevelop_3.1.0.4977_Setup.msi
   -# Get Windows 7 SDK which works for Vista and XP also. You can download the Windows 7 SDK from:<BR>
      Web Install: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=c17ba869-9671-4330-a63e-1fd44e0e2505

@section vs_setup Setup Visual Studio for TickZoom

   -# TickZoom offers "best effort" support for Visual Studio. If you have any doubt, please choose SharpDevelop instead of Visual Studio so as to get full support with any issues you have from TickZoom.
   -# You will need a version of Visual Studio which supports .NET 3.5. The install typically includes the Windows SDK.
   -# In Visual Studio, you must disable the feature that pops up dialog boxs for unhandled exceptions because of a defect in Visual Studio where it intercepts ordinary exceptions passed between DLLs. Otherwise, you will continually get these dialog boxes popping up when using Visual Studio with TickZoom.
